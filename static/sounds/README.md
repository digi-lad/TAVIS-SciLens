# Audio Files Needed

Please add the following audio files to this directory:

## 1. beep.mp3
- A short, clear beep sound (~0.5 seconds)
- Should play when ArUco markers are successfully detected and image is captured
- Recommended: 440Hz tone, clean and pleasant

## 2. processing.mp3
- A short sound to indicate processing is ongoing
- Should play every 2 seconds during image analysis
- Recommended: Soft chime or gentle tone (~0.3 seconds)

## Creating These Files

You can create these files using:

- Audacity (free audio editor)
- Any text-to-speech service saying "beep" and recording it
